                    <p>Vaastu Shastra is an ancient Indian science of architecture and construction that originated over 5,000 years ago. It combines elements of architecture, astrology, and spirituality to create spaces that are in harmony with natural forces. The word "Vaastu" refers to the physical environment, while "Shastra" means science or knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Vaastu principles are based on the understanding that everything in the universe is composed of five basic elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space. These elements must be balanced within a living or working space to create harmony and positivity that supports health, wealth, and happiness for its occupants.</p>
